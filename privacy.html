    <p>Full Bloom Software ("we", "our", or "us") operates the AirCalc mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>AirCalc is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.</p>

        <li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
        <li>General location (country/region level only, derived from IP address)</li>

    <p>This data is collected anonymously and cannot be used to identify individual users. It helps us improve the App's functionality and user experience.</p>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>Any data you create within AirCalc (such as calculations or saved values) is stored locally on your device only. We do not have access to this data, and it is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>
