## Important Notes

1. **Be Honest:** Google can audit your app. If you claim not to collect data but actually do, your app can be removed.

2. **Future Updates:** If you add analytics, crash reporting, or any data collection in the future, you MUST update this form.

3. **Privacy Policy is Required:** Even though you don't collect data, Google Play requires a privacy policy URL.

4. **Local Storage Doesn't Count:** Data stored locally on the device (like DataStore for timer state) does NOT need to be declared as "collected data" as long as it never leaves the device.

5. **Permissions:** The permissions you request (vibrate, notifications, alarms) do NOT need to be declared in data safety as long as they don't involve data collection or sharing.
